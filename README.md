# Facial Emotion Detection using CNN
This is completely a deep learning project entirely based on neural networks and I think Facial emotion detection project is one of the classical projects in deep learning.<br/>
<br/>We all know facial emotions play a vital role in our day-to-day life. so, we need a system which is capable of recognising our  facial emotions and able to act accordingly.
<br/>
<br/> 
This project is the first step in that system.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here I trained the convolution neural network with kaggle facial emotion dataset. so that it learns patterns for each facial expression and able to detect facial emotions
<br/>
<br/>

## Installation of python libraries:
  * keras with tensorflow as backend
  * OpenCV
  * numpy
  * pandas
  * matplotlib


## DataSet:
In this project I used kaggle dataset <br/>
